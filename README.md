# TimeOut - take home test
#### by Vitali Lupusor

## Assumptions
* There is Anaconda3/Miniconda3 installed on the machine.
* The Python version is 3.6.4 and higher.

## Tips
* For a Windows OS based machine execute **timeout.bat**
* For a Mac/Linus OS based machine execute **timeout.sh**
* For unit tests you can execute the files in the **./support_functions** folder

## Possible improvements
* In order to avoid using user's prompt, where the application is most likely to fail, I suggest switching to a web-app, where forms can be used to select from the list of existing members.
  * For that purpose I would recommend Flask, as it is light in execution and easy to use, when compared to Django.
* Use logs to introduce an easy-to-troubleshoot capability.

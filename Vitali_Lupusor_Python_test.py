Description: This is a practical test for the Senior Data Engineer position 
    with TimeOut. All the requirements are presented below.

    The Problem
    The Time Out team loves to socialise, some of us are also really fussy! 
    In order to spend less time deciding where to go weâ€™d like a program that 
    decides for us. All members of the team will want both food and drink so 
    if a member of staff cannot eat anything, or no drinks are served that 
    they like, the team will not visit the venue.

    The Input
    There are two JSON feeds, one of which is a list of the team members with 
    what they do drink and do not eat, the other feed contains venues with 
    the food and drink options for that venue.
    The person using the app needs to be able to enter which team members 
    will be attending.

    The Output
    The output should return which places are safe to go to, and if applicable 
    why the team should avoid the other places.
